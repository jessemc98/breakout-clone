## Simple BreakOut Clone
Simple breakout clone written for fun using HTML5 canvas and javascript ES6. (warning; although this code works, it was written over a weekend and is not optimized for production use)

after cloning repository, run `npm i && npm start` to install dependencies and run a local http server on port 3000 to serve the project files

```
Only works in new browsers as it is written in the ECMAScriptÂ® 2016 Language Specification.
